# BestStoreMVC

## 📝 Description
I developed an E-Commerce Web Application as part of a Udemy course project. The main focus of the project was user authentication, secure transactions through PayPal, and providing users with a rich selection of items. Users can choose to pay by credit/debit card, PayPal, or cash on delivery.
