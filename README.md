# BestStoreMVC

## üìù Description
<br>
I developed an E-Commerce Web Application as part of a Udemy course project. The main focus of the project was user authentication, secure transactions through PayPal, and providing users with a rich selection of items. Users can choose to pay by credit/debit card, PayPal, or cash on delivery.
<br>
<br>
The application also includes an Admin role. As an Admin, you can track when an order was made and update most order details, such as the order status and payment status (accepted, pending, or canceled). Additionally, you can manage user roles‚Äîusers can be Clients, Sellers, or Admins. Admins have the ability to delete user profiles, add new items to the store, or remove existing ones.
